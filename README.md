# Principles of Data Analytics
by: Hewa Orang

This repository is to fulfil the requirement of the *Principles of Data Analytics* module part of the HDip in Data Analytics.

# Contents

The repository contains the follwoing:

- **`tasks.ipynb`**: This notebook contains the assesments task rquirements. It includes the following sections:
  - **Task 1: Source the Data Set**: Loading the Iris dataset using `pandas` and `sklearn`.
  - **Task 2: Explore the Data Structure**: Inspecting the dataset structure, keys, and feature names.
  - **Task 3: Summarize the Data**: Generating summary statistics for numeric features.
  - **Task 4: Visualize Features**: Creating histograms for each feature using `matplotlib`.
  - **Task 5: Investigate Relationships**: Scatter plots to explore relationships between features.
  - **Task 6: Analyze Relationships**: Adding regression line to the scatter plot from task5.
  - **Task 7: Analyze Class Distributions**: Box plots for petal lengths grouped by class.
  - **Task 8: Compute Correlations**: Heatmap of feature correlations using `seaborn`.
  - **Task 9: Fit a Simple Linear Regression**: Fitting a linear regression model and annotating plots with RÂ² values.
  - **Task 10: Too Many Features**: Pair plots to visualize relationships across all features. 

- **`roughwork`**:  This folder includes the roughwork notebooks created while following weekly lectures of the module.

## Iris dataset
The iris dataset is a classic widely used dataset in machine learning. It was introduced by Ronald A.Fisher in 1936. It is frequently used for classification tasks. Each row in the dataset represents one flower with its four measurements and its corresponding label. 

## key features of the dataset:
-   150 Samples
-   3 Classes
    -   Setosa
    -   Versicolor
    -   Virginica
-   Features:
    -   Sepal length
    -   Sepal width
    -   Petal length
    -   Petal width
